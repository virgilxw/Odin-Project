Build the Android logo using just HTML and CSS by watching this video from an amazing website called The Code Player. It's like a tutorial but it actually plays the code as the original developer created it. Use your own text editor (which you can view by opening the .html file in your browser), JSFiddle's online tool or CodePen's online tool to create the logo alongside the tutorial.
Note: You will see border-radius, -moz-border-radius, and -webkit-border-radius all used identically. This is in order to overcome some of the differences between browsers. You probably only need to use border-radius to achieve the desired effect.
